          <h2>What are we?</h2>
          <p class="main-text">Cork city's <b>only</b> museum dedicated to the oldest and best of gaming history. <br>From ancient consoles to the most niche and rare games. Founded in 2019, a few of us hardcore gamers decided to get together to create this one stop location for all things retro gaming</p>
          <img src="img/museum.jpg" alt="video game museum"> <!-- Use of Alt text is also provided to help with SEO  -->
          <h2>Opening day!</h2>
          <p class="main-text">Time is <em>key</em> here, we have a lot of things at play currently and it has yet to be decided when in 2019 we will be able to open exactly. However! Please rest assured we will open as soon as the funds have been raised to meet the requirements of the space we plan to rent to host out museum.</p>
          <h2>Cost of entry/tickets?</h2>
          <p class="main-text">The answer is straight-forward enough, we're taking a risk and would like to educate and show everyone what our forefathers of gaming were capable of with such limited hardware, resources and time. We will of course accept any generous donations to help keep this gaming museum open and running for as long as possible!</p>
