# Web-Developement
Contained within this repository are my assignments completed during my time at college. This includes HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This specific webpage was designed to show off my learnings within the year attending my computer programming course at DCU.

It covers the following:

o	Pages developed in HTML using the HTML5 DOCTYPE specification.
o	Simple webpages with a good design and clean visual layout.
o	HTML comments, clear code alignment and indentation.
o	Effective use of SEO.
o	Include images, links and a location map (found on the Contact Us page).
o	Use of Relative Addressing to access images that are located in a subdirectory of the root folder
